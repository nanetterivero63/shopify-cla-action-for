# Shopify CLA action

## Use case

When activated and configured, a check will be added to every PR making sure
your CLA has been signed by all committers. If a committer has not signed your
CLA, the check will fail.

After signing the CLA, contributors can comment "I've signed the CLA!" on the PR to re-run the test suite.

This is intended for Shopify repositories only.

## Getting Started

Add the following workflow to your repository:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cla.yml
name: Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: |
      (github.event.issue.pull_request && !github.event.issue.pull_request.merged_at) 
      || (github.event.pull_request && !github.event.pull_request.merged)
    steps:
      - uses: Shopify/shopify-cla-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          cla-token: ${{ secrets.CLA_TOKEN }}
```
